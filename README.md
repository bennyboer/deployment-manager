# Deployment Manager
> In early development. Not really usable yet.

> Does currently only run within Google Chrome.

## Motivation
It seems like there is no easy to use tool available to just create a simple work schedule. This is my approach to tackle the problem of finding the best work schedule for everyone.

## Getting started
This is a web application using [Angular Dart](https://angulardart.org) and lateron will even feature a server which will provide the business logic.
1. Install Dart ([here](https://dartlang.org))
1. Run `pub get` on the command line in the root folder of this project
1. Run `pub run build_runner serve --live-reload` and the development server will start up
